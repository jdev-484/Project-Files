This project is meant for analysis of IoT sensor data using machine learning.As a case study, daily rainfall prediction problem is taken into consideration.The data collected are analysed with the help of machine learning technique in IBM Cloud environment and accordingly it is predicted that whether it will rain on tomorrow or not.
